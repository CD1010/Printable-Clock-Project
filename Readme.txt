This is a Creative Commons - Attribution - ShareAlike licensed project to create a working 3D-printable clock.

There have been 3D-printable clocks before, but as far as I know, this is the first effort to create one under an open-source license and with the goal to print it on something from the reprap family rather than a high-end commercial machine with support material and high resolution.

I am very grateful for the support and assistance from the Maker community over at Thingiverse.com, for MakerBot Industries gracious offer of a free 3D printer in support of this project.

In particular, Thingiverse users rustedrobot, emmet, ssd, barrychuck and MakerBlock have been invaluable, providing detailed feedback and insight on the various prototypes they printed out.

UPDATE: TheRuttmeister's print of TestJig #2 has passed all four tests. Looks like we have a working, printable escapement design. Major milestone passed!

UPDATE: rustedrobot's print of TestJig #2 has also passed the tests, after some manual post-processing, and we have video: http://www.prototribe.net/vidplay/testjig2.html
